While at Hack Reactor, I learned to become a "Conjurer" with regard to learning new concepts and technologies. This "shoot first, ask questions later" aproach made it possible to master Javascript and several frameworks in very short time. Today, one of my former classmates and I take on a new challenge: learn Scala in 10 days. 

It's sure to be a challenge and we may fail, but it's sure to be an interesting experience. I'll be trying to make a post each day to record progress!
